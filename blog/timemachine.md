"When you are close, you must see things from afar. When you are afar, you must see things up close." That's the paraphrased advice from Miyamoto Musashi, a 17th century Japanese swordsman who was victorious in a record 61 duels. To me, someone who literally lives and dies by their strategic decisions is someone to pay attention to. 

To me, strategy is one thing--it's our ability to shape the future. Strategy is destiny.
