# Recruiting (WIP)

At Mattermost we hire high horsepower team players with a growth mindset and we empower them to do the best work of their careers in alignment with our leadership principles. 

# Sourcing 

We source candidates in different ways and score their potential based on their drive times their reputation. 

## Sources 

We seek to find candidates from multiple sources: 

**Sourced candidates** are the result of active outreach from our team to see if someone might be interested in exploring a professional career at Mattermost. These candidates may or may not be seeking a career or company change. Quality of these candidates should be higher and more predictable, since 

**Inbound candidates** apply based on our job postings and typically are seeking a career or company change. Quality of these candidates can vary a lot. 

## Potential 

The potential of a candidate is the product of their drive times their reptuation: 

### Drive  

- High - Has been a user and fan of Mattermost for a while, has read our online content and is excited to join us. 
- Medium - Discovered Mattermost's online information and highlights what draws them to Mattermost as part of discussion 
- Low - Hasn't made a significant effort to learn about Mattermost after multiple meetings, or not interested in doing the best work of their career 

### Reputation  

- High - Highly recommended referral from colleages or strong public track record aligned to our recruiting criteria 
- Low - Referral from colleages other than top recommendation or has an online track record that is not disqualifying but also not outstanding (which is okay, since we're not hiring for how well people groom their public persona).  
- Out - Multiple signs that the candidate is not aligned with our recruiting criteria and leadership principles.

# Mutual Evaluation 

Candidates go through interviews and auditions to assess if: 

- They are high horsepower team players 
- We can empower them to do the best work of their careers
- Will the align well with our leadership principles? 

If the fit is mutual, the process continues. If at any point the candidate withdraws for two team members decide the candidate is not an appropriate fit, the process is discontinued. 

# CEO Final Interview
