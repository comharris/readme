# Mindsets

Below are some thoughts and readings that influence my thinking and world view: 

## Strategy

- **Strategy is Destiny** - One phrase I'll often repeat is "find the path to victory before the battle begins". A correct strategy once formulated should seem obvious, like the "difference between a pound weight measured against a feather." I tend to think short term and long term at the same time. I am comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, but I am not comfortable with a strategy that is incorrect. 

## Setting Values 

- **[Amazon's 14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles)** - Criteria for leaders in high performance, long-term focused organization. The ideas in here can be intense, and it's important to balance them out with approaches at other successful organizations, like Pixar (See "Creativity, Inc.").  

## Delegation 

- **[Leadership, Decision-Making and Emotion Management](
http://www.edbatista.com/2017/02/leadership-decision-making-and-emotion-management.html)** - This article outlines different approaches to decision making, I'm focused on approaches 3 to 7.

## Prioritization 

- **"You won't get to where you're going if you stop to throw a rock at every dog that barks" (Winston Churchill)** - An important reminder for me to not get bogged down in things that aren't vital, despite the dopamine hit of fixing small problems. The natural habits I have for building new businesses need to be moderated as a CEO who needs to seek the highest possible leverage to increase organizational output. 

- **[War of Art](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/)** - Book on how to overcome resistance to things we need to do, but don't want to do. It's about professional writing specifically, but can apply to many things we need to do and put off. 

## Persistence 

- **"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." (Michael Jordan)** - When we have a set back, this is a nice reminder that persistence pays off. 

## Art 

- **"Eternity is in love with the productions of time" (William Blake)** - This is from a poem so open to interpretation. Mine is that eternity--a crazy, immortal realm we can't understand--is infatuated by what we create here on earth. I believe what seems fleeting and ephemeral to us can have a grander significance than we can imagine.

# Values 

Values are deliberate choices defining our behavior.  When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity (CUA) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our values. Here are some I use:

- **Minimize regret** - This is about making decisions from the perspective of being 80 years old and looking back. It helps highlight the difference between short term and long term priorities. 

- **Others-centered** - Putting yourself in the minds and contexts of other people to understand where they're coming from and how what you're doing affects them. I'm influenced here by [Mark Canlis](http://canlis.com/about/people/our-team/mark-canlis/) who runs a restaurant and when there's chaos and disaster all he wants his team to keep in mind is being "others-centered", and everything works. 

# Hiring 

- **Values first, then aptitude, then domain expertise** - Alignment of values is the most important variable in a team. Person A 100% aligned at 70% output is far better than someone 70% aligned at 100% output. Output can be increased through training and experience, but alignment cannot. Next, aptitude is more important than domain expertise since expertise can be developed or outsourced but raw aptitude is constant. Another way to state it: "hire for CPU, not hard disk". 
 
- **Drive is vital** - Two variables determine individual performance: Drive and training. Someone with incredible drive, who may be less experienced and less gifted at the outset, will outperform people with more stature over time. Drive means growth, and growth is everything.

- **Academic distinction helps** - What we do when we're young has life-long impact. Academics, leadership, sports, hobbies significantly shape who we are. Distinction suggests either talent or effort, and often both. While we shouldn't discount "late bloomers", it's easier to see the success of early bloomers echoing through life. 

# Quirks

- **I tend to tie everything to principles and process.** - We never get our time back. To make the most out of all the time we have, I tend to find principles and processes for both large and small decisions. As an example, when ordering at a new restaurant I'll tend to find out from the server which dishes are most popular and order the popular option 80-90% of the time.
