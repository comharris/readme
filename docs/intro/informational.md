# WIP: CEO Informational 

Hi there, 

I'm looking forward to meeting you for a CEO informational, 

This meeting is an opportunity for us to share about the opportunity at Mattermost, and to get to know each other. 

Mattermost is a fast-growing open core software company delivering a high trust, developer-first collaboration platform to Global 2000 enterprises. We announced [a $20M Series A from RedPoint in 2019](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-open-source-mattermost-is-sneaking-up-on-slacks-messaging-empire/) and brought on an [executive leadership team](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/27/1780869/0/en/Mattermost-Builds-out-Executive-Leadership-Team-Adds-Board-of-Advisors-and-Opens-San-Francisco-Office.html) to scale the business. 

- We are focused on being the commercial open source leader in the enterprise collaboration market
  -  The market is expected to grow from $34.57B in 2018 to nearly $60B in 2023 with a CAGR of 11.6%
  -  Just as open source has disrupted operating systems, databases, and browsers we plan to lead the disruption of the enterprise collaboration marketing with an open source platform 

- Our first product is an "open source Slack-alternative"--sometimes called "Slack for paranoid people" 
  -  Each open source Mattermost server can host hundreds of Slack-compatible teams 
     -  This includes compatible integrations via webhooks, compatible keyboard shortcuts, you can import Slack teams--you can even import Slack theme colors   
  -  Every month over 10,000 servers are downloaded ([see video](https://twitter.com/Mattermost/status/1116903841633587201))

- Increasingly a "Slack or Mattermost" is needed as a defacto part of DevOps toolchains  
  -  Mattermost wins over Slack in enterprises with "high trust" teams that need: 
     -  Privacy - Use of a self-managed system where usage and data remains entirely under customer control  
     -  Total data ownership - Ability to own and control all messages and files shared with no 3rd party knowledge 
     -  Control and customization - Full source code access and ability to extend and tailor functionality to user needs 
  -  Once adopted by DevOps, Mattermost becomes a platform for high trust workflows and can spread to the rest of the company 

- Our business is "buyer-based open core". 
  -  Our core product is free, open source and focused on developers   
  -  We sell an enterprise version of Mattermost with compliance features to IT departments ([see features](https://mattermost.com/pricing-feature-comparison/)). 
 
Mattermost is an [open source, remote-first, communities-centered company](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/handbook.html#company) based in Palo Alto and headquartered on the internet. 

Our CTO is in Seattle area, our VPS is in Hillsborough, VPM in Marin, VPF in San Francisco, VP People in Redwood City and CEO in Palo Alto. We do most meetings remote with monthly in-person meetings in San Francisco.
