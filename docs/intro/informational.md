# WIP: CEO Informational 

Hi there, 

I'm looking forward to meeting you for a CEO informational, 

This meeting is an opportunity for us to share about the opportunity at Mattermost, and to get to know each other. 

Mattermost is a fast-growing open core software company delivering a high trust, developer-first collaboration platform to Global 2000 enterprises. We announced [a $20M Series A from RedPoint in 2019](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-open-source-mattermost-is-sneaking-up-on-slacks-messaging-empire/) and brought on an [executive leadership team](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/27/1780869/0/en/Mattermost-Builds-out-Executive-Leadership-Team-Adds-Board-of-Advisors-and-Opens-San-Francisco-Office.html) to scale the business. 

- Our first product is an "open source Slack-alternative"--sometimes called "Slack for paranoid people" 
  -  Each open source Mattermost server can host hundreds of Slack-compatible teams 
     -  This includes compatible integrations via webhooks, compatible keyboard shortcuts, you can import Slack teams--you can even import Slack theme colors   
  -  Every month over 10,000 servers are downloaded ([see video](https://twitter.com/Mattermost/status/1116903841633587201))

- Increasingly a "Slack or Mattermost" is needed as a defacto part of DevOps toolchains  
  -  Mattermost wins over Slack in enterprises with "high trust" teams that need: 
     -  Privacy - Use of a self-managed system where usage and data remains entirely under customer control  
     -  Total data ownership - Ability to own and control all messages and files shared with no 3rd party knowledge 
     -  Control and customization - Full source code access and ability to extend and tailor functionality to user needs 
  -  Once adopted by DevOps, Mattermost becomes a platform for high trust workflows and can spread to the rest of the company

- Our business is "buyer-based open core". 
  -  Our core product is free, open source and focused on developers   
  -  We sell an enterprise version of Mattermost with compliance features to IT departments ([see features](https://mattermost.com/pricing-feature-comparison/)). 

I'm looking forward to meeting you to share more about our company, 

Ian
