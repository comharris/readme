# CEO Informational 

Hi there, 

I'm looking forward to meeting you for a CEO informational, 

This meeting is an opportunity for us to share about the opportunity at Mattermost, to start to get to know each other, and see if a full exec hiring cycle would be appropriate on both sides. 

Mattermost is an open source, remote-first company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. We have a sales and marketing office in San Francisco and the majority of our team distributed across the world, primarily in North America and Europe. You can learn more about our team on LinkedIn and our exec team on our bios page. 

I'm primarily based in a home office in Palo Alto, working mainly remote, and am in the San Francisco office maybe once a week when I'm not travelling. 

I'm looking forward to meeting you to share more about our company, 

Ian
