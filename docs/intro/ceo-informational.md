# CEO Informational 

Hi there, 

I'm looking forward to meeting you for a CEO informational, 

This meeting is an opportunity for us to share about the opportunity at Mattermost, and to get to know each other. 

Mattermost is a fast-growing open core software company delivering a high trust collaboration platform to Global 2000 enterprises. In 2019 we announced [a $20M Series A from RedPoint in 2019](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-open-source-mattermost-is-sneaking-up-on-slacks-messaging-empire/) and brought on a new [executive leadership team](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/27/1780869/0/en/Mattermost-Builds-out-Executive-Leadership-Team-Adds-Board-of-Advisors-and-Opens-San-Francisco-Office.html) to scale the business. 

Here's four things to know about Mattermost: 

- One - We are focused on disrupting the enterprise collaboration market as the open source leader 
  -  The market is expected to grow from $34.57B in 2018 to nearly $60B in 2023 with a CAGR of 11.6%
  -  Just as open source has won over operating systems, databases, and browsers we plan to lead the disruption of the enterprise collaboration market with an open source platform  

- Two - Our first product is an "open source Slack-alternative"--aka "Slack for paranoid people" 
  -  Each open source Mattermost server can host hundreds of Slack-compatible teams 
     -  This includes compatible integrations via webhooks, compatible keyboard shortcuts, you can import Slack teams--you can even import Slack theme colors   
  -  Every month over 10,000 servers are downloaded ([see video](https://twitter.com/Mattermost/status/1116903841633587201))
  -  Increasingly a "Slack or Mattermost" is needed as a defacto part of DevOps toolchains  
     -  Mattermost and Slack offer largely the same thing: Productivity, Collaboration and Transformation 
        -  We reduce email, speed workflows, and become a central hub for everything your teams needs 
     -  Mattermost wins over Slack in enterprises for high trust organizations that need: 
        -  Privacy - Use of a self-managed system where usage and data remains entirely under customer control  
        -  Total data ownership - Ability to own and control all messages and files shared with no 3rd party knowledge 
        -  Control and customization - Full source code access and ability to extend and tailor functionality to user needs 
  -  Once adopted by DevOps, our platform starts to spread to the rest of the company via structured and unstructured workflows  

- Three - Our business is "buyer-based open core". 
  -  Our core product is free, open source and focused on developers   
  -  We sell an enterprise version of Mattermost with compliance features to IT departments ([see features](https://mattermost.com/pricing-feature-comparison/)). 
  -  The business is doing well 

- Four - Mattermost is an [open source, remote-first, communities-centered company](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/handbook.html#company) based in Palo Alto and headquartered on the internet. 

  -  Our CTO is in Seattle area, our VPS is in Hillsborough, VPM in Marin, VPF in San Francisco, VP People in Redwood City, and CEO is in Palo Alto. 
  -  We do most meetings remote with monthly in-person meetings in San Francisco.
