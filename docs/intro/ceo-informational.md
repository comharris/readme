PS: Here's four things to know about Mattermost: 

- One - We are focused on disrupting the enterprise collaboration market as the open source leader 

  -  The market is expected to grow from $34.57B in 2018 to nearly $60B in 2023 with a CAGR of 11.6%
  -  Just as open source has won over operating systems and databases, we plan to lead the disruption of the enterprise collaboration market with an open source platform  

- Two - Our first product is an "open source Slack-alternative"--aka "Slack for paranoid people" 

  -  Each open source Mattermost server can host hundreds of Slack-compatible teams 
     -  This includes Slack-compatible webhook integrations, Slack keyboard shortcuts, you can import Slack teams--you can even import Slack theme colors   
  -  Every month over 10,000 servers are downloaded 
  -  Increasingly a "Slack or Mattermost" is needed for DevOps toolchains  
     -  Mattermost and Slack offer largely the same thing: Productivity, Collaboration and Transformation 
        -  We reduce email, speed workflows, and become a central hub for everything your teams needs 
     -  Mattermost wins over Slack in enterprises for high trust organizations that need: 
        -  Privacy - Use of a self-managed system where usage and data remains entirely under customer control  
        -  Total data ownership - Ability to own and control all messages and files shared with no 3rd party knowledge 
        -  Control and customization - Full source code access and ability to extend and tailor functionality to user needs 
  -  Once adopted by DevOps, our platform starts to spread to the rest of the company via structured and unstructured workflows  

- Three - Our business is "buyer-based open core". 

  -  Our core product is free, open source and focused on developers   
  -  We sell an enterprise version of Mattermost with compliance features to IT departments ([see features](https://mattermost.com/pricing-feature-comparison/)). 
  -  The business is doing well 

- Four - Mattermost is an [open source, remote-first, communities-centered company](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/handbook.html#company) based in Palo Alto and headquartered on the internet. 

  -  Our CTO is in Seattle area, our VPS is in Hillsborough, VPM in Marin, VPF in San Francisco, VP People in Redwood City, and CEO is in Palo Alto
  -  We have concentrations of people around London, Berlin, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. and a physical office for a portion of the finance, marketing and inside sales teams in San Francisco  
  -  As a company we bring the company together annually, in partnership with our customers and open source community
  -  The leadership team typically meets remotely with monthly in-person meetings in the San Francisco office
