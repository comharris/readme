Hi, I'm Ian. 

This is my README page to get to know how I operate.  

If we are potentially working together, this page is a way to understand who I am and how I think before and after the meeting, which hopefully saves everyone some time. And time is all we have.

# Working with me

Here's some basic things to know about working with me: 

1. **Most things are 1 or 0 to me.** Either things are correct and excellent and as they should be (a "1"), or things are wrong and need to be fixed or de-prioritized (a "0"). It's difficult for me to conceive of answers "in between". I tend to agree, disagree, or need more information. I understand that not everyone thinks this way, or should think this way, this is just how I think. 

2. **I think in systems.** In my mind, software, businesses, art, music and people are all systems. Each has their history, parameters, dynamics and opportunities. Understanding history and current state informs the future. The song [the Hook](http://www.avclub.com/article/why-hook-by-blues-traveler-is-actually-a-pretty-ge-83392) by Blues Traveller is a wonderful example of understanding music as a system. 

3. **I'm an extrovert.** My energy increases when I'm communicating with other people (including on video calls, via messaging and in person). When I am working alone for long periods of time, my energy decreases. 

4. **I'm logical.** In university I studied cognition and built software simulating different models of thinking (rules-based, pattern-based, dynamic/chaotic systems, etc.). I believe emotions help us arrive quickly at potential solutions, and once delivered logic must vet our analysis and conclusion.

## Special situations

Here are some things to know about me in special situations: 

1. **Sometimes I ask a series of precise, close-ended questions.** When discussing something important, I ask very specific questions like: "How long has the regression been known to exist in the product?", "Who's responsible for replying to the contributor?", "When was the last time that person replied to any contributor?" This line of questions may seem uncomfortable to some people who prefer a more casual style of conversation. Please understand I have no intention of treating people differently, I am just trying to understand facts quickly. 

2. **When exploring new ideas, I consider multiple possibilities at the same time.** As brainstorming discussions seem to converge on a path, I may start asking questions in the opposite direction to see if the consensus falls apart, or if other paths are properly eliminated and we end up at the same conclusion. That said, once we have agreement, I am 100% behind the direction and will repeated it endlessly.

3. **If you're not a native English speaker, I'm happy to speak slower and more simply. Please signal to me to do this.** - Signalling me with a facial expression or just letting me know if I'm difficult to understand is highly appreciated. I know how you feel. In addition to English, I speak conversational Mandarin in an accent that can make me sound more fluent than I am. I struggle when a native speaker uses advanced vocabulary.

4. **If you're not Canadian, you may think I say "sorry" unnecessarily.** - This is how I grew up and I realize it sometimes causes confusion. When I say "sorry" it sometimes means I am empathetically disappointed that things could not be in a more ideal state (short for "I'm sorry to hear that"), and sometimes it means I'm apologizing for an error that I made. 

# Mindsets

Below are some thoughts and readings that influence my thinking and world view: 

## Strategy

- **Strategy is Destiny** - One phrase I'll often repeat is "find the path to victory before the battle begins". A correct strategy once formulated should seem obvious, like the "difference between a pound weight measured against a feather." I tend to think short term and long term at the same time. I am comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, but I am not comfortable with a strategy that is incorrect. 

## Setting Values 

- **[Amazon's 14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles)** - Criteria for leaders in high performance, long-term focused organization. The ideas in here can be intense, and it's important to balance them out with approaches at other successful organizations, like Pixar (See "Creativity, Inc.").  

## Delegation 

- **[Leadership, Decision-Making and Emotion Management](
http://www.edbatista.com/2017/02/leadership-decision-making-and-emotion-management.html)** - An idea on when to decide and when to delegate decisions and the processes in-between. 

## Prioritization 

- **"You won't get to where you're going if you stop to throw a rock at every dog that barks" - Winston Churchill** - An important reminder for me to not get bogged down in things that aren't vital, despite the dopamine hit of fixing small problems. The natural habits I have for building new businesses need to be moderated as a CEO who needs to seek the highest possible leverage to increase organizational output. 

- **[War of Art](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/)** - Book on how to overcome resistance to things we need to do, but don't want to do. It's about professional writing specifically, but can apply to many things we need to do and put off. 

## Persistence 

- **"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." - Michael Jordan** - When we have a set back, this is a nice reminder that persistence pays off. 

## Art 

- **"Eternity is in love with the productions of time" - William Blake** - This is from a poem so open to interpretation. Mine is that eternity--a crazy, immortal realm we can't understand--is infatuated by what we create here on earth. I believe what seems fleeting and ephemeral to us has a grander significance than we can imagine.

# Values 

Values are deliberate choices defining our behavior.  When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity (CUA) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our values. Here are some I use:

- **Minimize regret** - This is about making decisions from the perspective of being 80 years old and looking back. It helps highlight the difference between short term and long term priorities. 

- **Others-centered** - Putting yourself in the minds and contexts of other people to understand where they're coming from and how what you're doing affects them. I got this idea from [Mark Canlis](http://canlis.com/about/people/our-team/mark-canlis/) when he gave a talk about running a restaurant, and at some point there's going to be chaos and disaster and when it happens the one thing he wants his team to keep in mind is being "others-centered". 

# Hiring 

- **Values first, then aptitude, then domain expertise** - Alignment of values is the most important variable in a team. Person A 100% aligned at 70% output is far better than someone 70% aligned at 100% output. Output can be increased through training and experience, but alignment cannot. Next, aptitude is more important than domain expertise since expertise can be developed or outsourced but raw aptitude is constant. Another way to state it: "hire for CPU, not hard disk". 
 
- **Drive is vital** - Two variables determine individual performance: Drive and training. Someone with incredible drive, who may be less experienced and less gifted at the outset, will outperform people with more stature over time. Drive means growth, and growth is everything.

- **Academic distinction helps** - What we do when we're young has life-long impact. Academics, leadership, sports, hobbies significantly shape who we are. Distinction suggests either talent or effort, and often both. While we shouldn't discount "late bloomers", early bloomers have the advantage.  

# Quirks

- **I tend to tie everything to principles and process.** - We never get our time back. To make the most out of all the time we have, I tend to find principles and processes for both large and small decisions. As an example, when ordering at a new restaurant I'll tend to find out from the server which dishes are most popular and order the popular option 80-90% of the time.
