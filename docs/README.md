Hi, I'm Ian. 

This is my README page. Sometimes when you download a package of software it comes with a file called "README", which explains the contents of the package. 

I've created a README file for myself, to share a bit about me, including my own perception of how I think and how I behave. 

If you and I are planning to meet, either socially, professionally or both, I hope this page provides some context on me ahead of our discussion. 

It's not an exhaustive list--for example, I leave out family here, as not everyone is comfortable being discussed on the internet--it's what I hope will be helpful to get to know me before or after we meet. 

# Basic info and biography

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iantien). 

# How I think and behave 

Here is my opinion about how [I think and behave](how_i_think). 

# Mindsets

This section details the [mindsets](mindsets) I use as tools to frame the world and get things done in different contexts. In his book "Creativity, Inc." John Lasseter lists out mindsets he uses at Pixar--as frameworks to "try on" in different situations. Mindsets aren't intended to be consistent, they are tools to use when the right situation arises. 

# How I manage my time 

Here is [how my calendar is organized](https://github.com/it33/readme/blob/master/docs/calendar.md). 

# "CEO and Friends" Dinners

Occassionally I'll co-host [CEO Dinners](ceo_dinners) for fellow CEOs and other friends, typically in San Francisco. I document the logistics here so that invitees can know what to expect--and can read up on me in advance if they're interested.
