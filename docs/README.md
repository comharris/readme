Hi, I'm Ian. 

This is my README page to get to know me. 

If we are potentially socializing or working together, this page is a way to understand who I am and how I think before and after the meeting, which hopefully saves everyone some time. And time is all we have.

# Basic info and biography

You can read about what I do on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/), and what I'm up to currently at [@iantien](https://twitter.com/iantien) on Twitter. 

# How I think and behave 

You can read my opinion about how [I think and behave](how_i_think). While I'm laying out my own impression about myself, I'm not able to be objective, so if you have feedback to share, I'd be appreciative. 

# Mindsets

This section details the [mindsets](mindsets) I use as tools to frame the world and get things done in different contexts. In his book "Creativity, Inc." John Lasster lists out mindsets he uses at Pixar--as frameworks to "try on" in different situations. Mindsets aren't intended to be consistent, they are tools to use when the right situation arrises. 

# CEO and Friends Dinners

Occassionally I'll co-host [CEO Dinners](how_i_think) for fellow CEOs and other friends, typically in San Francisco. I document the logistics here so that invitees can know what to expect--and can read up on me in advance if they're interested.
