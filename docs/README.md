Hi, I'm Ian. I'm trying out GitHub pages and decided to write-up some materials on what I'm reading. In my mind, there's nothing that shapes who you are more than the people you spend time with and the materials that you read, so I wanted to share at least part of what's shaping me. 

If you meet me in person, this page is a way to understand who I am and how I think before and after the meeting, which hopefully saves everyone some time. And time is all we have. 

# Readings

## Setting Values 

- **[Amazon's 14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles)** - Criteria for leaders in high performance, long-term focused organization. 

## Delegation 

- **[Leadership, Decision-Making and Emotion Management](
http://www.edbatista.com/2017/02/leadership-decision-making-and-emotion-management.html)** - An idea on when to decide and when to delegate decisions and the processes in-between. 

## Prioritization 

- **"You won't get to where you're going if you stop to throw a rock at every dog that barks" - Winston Churchill** - An important reminder for me to not get bogged down in things that aren't vital, despite the dopamine hit of fixing small errors. 

- **[War of Art](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/the-war-of-art/)** - Book on how to overcome resistance to things we need to do, but don't want to do. It's about professional writing specifically, but can apply to many things we need to do and put off. 


## Art 

- **"Eternity is in love with the productions of time" - William Blake** - This is from a poem so open to interpretation. Mine is that eternity--a crazy, immortal realm we can't understand--is infatuated by what we create here on earth. So what seems fleeting and ephemeral has a grander significance than we can imagine.

  I used to like this other quote from the movie "Gladiator" which was "what we do in life echoes on in eternity", but now I feel like that line is a reductive, Hollywood-version of the original (Maybe because after he says the line, the General leading the armies of Rome rushes into the front line of battle to do hand-to-hand combat).

# Values 

Values are deliberate choices defining our behavior.  When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity (CUA) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our values. Here are some I use:

- **Minimize regret** - This is about making decisions from the perspective of being 80 years old and looking back. It helps highlight the difference between short term and long term priorities. 

- **Others-centered** - Putting yourself in the minds and contexts of other people to understand where they're coming from and how what you're doing affects them. I got this idea from [Mark Canlis](http://canlis.com/about/people/our-team/mark-canlis/) when he gave a talk about running a restaurant, and at some point there's going to be chaos and disaster and when it happens the one thing he wants his team to keep in mind is being "others-centered".
