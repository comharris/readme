# Reading (work-in-progress)

Hi, I'm Ian. I'm trying out GitHub pages and decided to write-up some materials on what I'm reading. In my mind, there's nothing that shapes who you are more than the people you spend time with and the materials that you read, so I wanted to share at least part of what's shaping me. 

If you meet me in person, this page is a way to understand who I am and how I think before and after the meeting, which hopefully saves everyone some time. And time is all we have. 


## Values 

- [Amazon's 14 leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles) - Criteria for leaders in high performance, long-term focused organization. 

## Delegation 

- [Leadership, Decision-Making and Emotion Management](
http://www.edbatista.com/2017/02/leadership-decision-making-and-emotion-management.html) - An idea on when to decide and when to delegate decisions and the processes in-between. 

## Prioritization 

- `"You won't get to where you're going if you stop to throw a rock at every dog that barks" - Winston Churchill.` 

  An important reminder for me to not get bogged down in details, despite the dopamine hit of correcting a small error.
