Hi, I'm Ian. 

This is a README page to learn more about my workstyle prior to meeting socially or professionally. 

# Basic info and biography

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iantien). 

# How I think and behave 

Here is my opinion about how [I think and behave](how_i_think). 

# Mindsets

I use [mindsets](mindsets) as tools to frame the world in different contexts. Mindsets are not consistent or universal, they are different tools for different situations. 

# How I manage my time 

Here is [how my calendar is organized](calendar). 

# "CEO and Friends" Dinners

Occassionally I'll co-host [CEO Dinners](ceo_dinners) for fellow CEOs and other friends, typically in San Francisco. I document the logistics here so that invitees can know what to expect--and can read up on me in advance if they're interested.
