Hi, I'm Ian. 

This is my README page. Sometimes when you download a package of software it comes with a file called "README", which explains the contents of the package. 

I've created a README file for myself, to help share a bit about me, including my own perception of how I think and how I behave. 

If you and I are planning to meet, either socially, professionally or both, this page is a way to understand a bit more about me, if you are interested. 

It's not an exhaustive list--for example, I leave out family here, as not everyone is comfortable being discussed on the internet--it's what I hope will be helpful to get to know me before or after we meet. 

# Basic info and biography

You can read about what I do on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/), and what I'm up to currently at [@iantien](https://twitter.com/iantien) on Twitter. 

# How I think and behave 

You can read my opinion about how [I think and behave](how_i_think). While I'm laying out my own impression about myself, I'm not able to be objective, so if you have feedback to share, I'd be appreciative. 

# Mindsets

This section details the [mindsets](mindsets) I use as tools to frame the world and get things done in different contexts. In his book "Creativity, Inc." John Lasster lists out mindsets he uses at Pixar--as frameworks to "try on" in different situations. Mindsets aren't intended to be consistent, they are tools to use when the right situation arrises. 

# CEO and Friends Dinners

Occassionally I'll co-host [CEO Dinners](ceo_dinners) for fellow CEOs and other friends, typically in San Francisco. I document the logistics here so that invitees can know what to expect--and can read up on me in advance if they're interested.
