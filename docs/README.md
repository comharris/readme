Hi, I'm Ian. 

This is a README page to learn more about my workstyle prior to meeting socially or professionally. 

- **Bio on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iantien)** - Work life overview.
- **[How I think and behave](how_i_think)** - My opinion on how I think and behave.
- **[Mindsets](mindsets)** - Tools I use to frame the world in different contexts. Mindsets are not consistent or universal, they are different tools for different situations. 
- **[How I manage my time](calendar)** - Algorithm for managing my calendar. 
- **[CEO Dinners](ceo_dinners)** - I'll host these for fellow CEOs and other friends, typically in San Francisco. 

How recently was this README updated? 
- My favorite bands right now are Goo Goo Dolls and BNL. 
- Right now I'm into "Hallelujah" from Pentatonix's Christmas album, "Your Song" by Elton John, and "Let Her Go" by Passenger.
