Hi, I'm Ian. 

This is my README page to get to know how I operate.  

If we are potentially working together, this page is a way to understand who I am and how I think before and after the meeting, which hopefully saves everyone some time. And time is all we have.

You can read about what I do on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/), and what I'm up to currently at [@iantien](https://twitter.com/iantien) on Twitter. 

# A) How I think 

Here's some basic things to know about working with me: 

1. **Most things are 1 or 0 to me.** Either things are correct and excellent and as they should be (a "1"), or things are wrong and need to be fixed or de-prioritized (a "0"). It's difficult for me to conceive of answers "in between". I tend to agree, disagree, or need more information. I understand that not everyone thinks this way, or should think this way, this is just how I think. 

2. **I'm influenced by facts, data and new perspectives.** If you show me facts, data or a framing that brings me to a different conclusion, I can change my view on something quickly. I work best with people who are comfortable having a dialog. 

3. **I'm an extrovert.** My energy increases when I'm communicating with other people (including on video calls, via messaging and in person). When I am working alone for long periods of time, my energy decreases. 

4. **I think in systems.** In my mind, software, businesses, art, music and people are all systems. Each has their history, parameters, dynamics and opportunities. Understanding history and current state informs the future. The song [the Hook](http://www.avclub.com/article/why-hook-by-blues-traveler-is-actually-a-pretty-ge-83392) by Blues Traveller is a wonderful example of understanding music as a system. 

5. **I aspire to be logical.** In university I studied cognition and built software simulating different models of thinking (rules-based, pattern-based, dynamic/chaotic systems, etc.). I believe emotions help us arrive quickly at potential solutions, and once delivered logic must vet our analysis and conclusion. If I have a strong first impression about something (good or bad), I try to not let it over influence my final decision. 

# B) How I behave

Here are some things to know about me in special situations: 

1. **Sometimes I ask a series of precise, close-ended questions.** When discussing something important, I ask very specific questions like: "How long has the regression been known to exist in the product?", "Who's responsible for replying to the contributor?", "When was the last time that person replied to any contributor?" This line of questions may seem uncomfortable to some people who prefer a more casual style of conversation. Please understand I have no intention of treating people differently, I am just trying to understand facts quickly. 

2. **When exploring ideas, I consider multiple possibilities at the same time.** As brainstorming discussions seem to converge on a path, I may start asking questions in the opposite direction to see if the consensus falls apart, or if other paths are properly eliminated and we end up at the same conclusion. I may ask questions down paths others feel should be eliminated earlier because I find sometimes those questions uncover new paths not considered. That said, once we have agreement, I am 100% behind the direction and will repeated it endlessly.

3. **If you're not a native English speaker, I'm happy to speak slower and more simply. Please signal to me to do this.** - Signalling me with a facial expression or just letting me know if I'm difficult to understand is highly appreciated. I know how you feel. In addition to English, I speak conversational Mandarin in an accent that can make me sound more fluent than I am. I struggle when a native speaker uses advanced vocabulary.

4. **If you're not Canadian, you may think I say "sorry" unnecessarily.** - This is how I grew up and I realize it sometimes causes confusion. When I say "sorry" it sometimes means I am empathetically disappointed that things could not be in a more ideal state (short for "I'm sorry to hear that"), and sometimes it means I'm apologizing for an error that I made.
