# CEO Administration Handbook 

The primary purpose of this handbook is to document, analyze and optimize the systems in which CEO tasks are administrated by the support team, specifically executive assistant ("EA") in order for the CEO to provide higher levels of service to the company. 

## Calendar Management 

If you're scheduling time with me, the below outlines the algorithm I try to use for managing meetings. I may delegate scheduling and rescheduling to a member of our team or a bot. 

### General guidelines: 

- Meetings should be scheduled for 25 minutes on weekdays 
- Meetings with partners or managing directors of VC firms should be scheduled for 60 minutes on weekdays
- 1:1 meetings with leads should be scheduled for 30 minutes on weekdays and are held weekly

- The following guidelines on schedule are for San Francisco timezone: 
  - 7am-9am SF time reserved for meetings with attendees outside North America    
  - 9am-1pm SF time is for conventional and standing meetings  
  - 1pm-1:30pm SF time reserved for lunch, but can book over if needed  
  - 2pm-3:30pm SF time reserved for overflow meetings 
  - 3:30pm-5pm SF time reserved for overflow overflow meetings 

Time when not in meetings is for messaging, email, and individual work. 

### Scheduling

Below are guidelines for scheduling and calendaring meetings.

#### External Meetings with Referrals

When the meeting is neither an informational meeting nor a candidate interview, the calendar invitation's subject should include the referral's name, CEO's name, and "Re: Mattermost" (e.g. Joan Thomas-Ian Tien Re: Mattermost). (Calendar Color: Tomato) 

### Rescheduling 

Sometimes I need to reschedule meetings and below outlines how I try to prioritize rescheduling and whether the rescheduling is done by me ("self-managed") or someone on our team ("delegated").

Reschedule lower level category before rescheduling higher level category.

#### Category 5 (rescheduling delegated) 

- IJT Staff Meetings (aka "Leads") 
- Advisers with frequent meetings and expectations of regular cancellations
- Customers, partners, investors, analysts, advisers, first meetings with referrals from key contacts (Calendar Color: Tomato) 

Avoid rescheduling unless I'm on a plane, in transit or a place that's loud and has poor internet. If we have to reschedule, please ping me so I can write the note myself. 

- Customer Obsession Meeting (Calendar Color: Tomato) 

Note: If I can't make the Customer Obsession Meeting, please announce in the channel and delegate running the meeting to Corey or his assign. 

#### Category 4 (rescheduling delegated) 

- IJT Staff Meetings, aka "Leads" (Calendar Color: Banana) 

#### Category 3 (rescheduling delegated) 

- Multi-person meetings with staff and vendors (Calendar Color: Tangerine) 

#### Category 2 (rescheduling delegated) 

- 1-1 meetings with staff and vendors (Calendar Color: Blueberry) 

Note: If 1-1 is weekly or bi-weekly, please cancel, otherwise, reschedule

#### Category 1 (rescheduling self-work) 

- Self-assigned time for work (Calendar Color: Flamingo) 

#### Travel Time (okay to take calls) 

- Time allocated for travel when it's typically okay to take phone calls (Calendar Color: Sage) 

## Email Management

### Queries from potential new investors 

#### Cold new investor queries 

When receiving repeated cold investor email queries from the same person, often an analyst, CEO may forward EA the mail with "LNI" short for "List of New Investors", which indicates that EA should loop in, thank them for their time and let the investor know we'll add them to the [list of funds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E9ks7mXmQBxrxvzGbL530bA5AzLHFiz5iq-hldaVc3Q/edit#gid=0) to contact in our next capital raise (bcc CEO).  

#### Warm / informed new investor queries 

When an investor queries comes from a warm intro, or is someone who appears highly informed about our space (Open source, Team Collaboration, DevOps / InfoSec, etc.) CEO may loop in and suggest 25m Zoom or phone meeting.  

### Vendor Requests

Vendors we pay will sometimes reach out directly to CEO for payment. CEO may forward EA the mail with "UPI" short for "Update Payment Information", which indicates that EA should loop in, share contact information for payment team (payments@mattermost.com), and share instructions for invoicing ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#heading=h.ispv9ka8whak))(bcc CEO).

### Recommendations

When sharing recommendations for CEO decisions (e.g. signatures), indicate your level of confidence or attachment to the outcome by adding x/5 ([0/5, 1/5...5/5](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#id8)) to the email's subject line. Add the x/5 as the first item in the subject line so that it is easily readable on a mobile phone. Please also add the x/5 to the email's body.

## Other Tasks

### Ordering Meals

For food ordered in (such as during an all day meeting), choose foods that are low carb, low sugar, non-spicy; fat is okay. 

- OK: Chicken or duck salad with oil and vinegar/citrus (no croutons), vegetarian meals with protien substitute.
- Avoid: Spicy food, thick-sliced bread, food that needs heating, food that can be spilled 

## Travel 

Please calendar car and air travel as follows: 

### Car Travel - COLOR - Sage  

- From home office to SFO book 50 minutes typically and 90 minutes in rush hour 
- For other drives, please calculate driving distance and add 10 minutes for trips less than 30 minutes and 20 minutes for trips longer than 30 minutes (Note: Need to revise these numbers with data) 

Title: `"CAR: " & [Origin] & " to " & [Destination]`
- Examples: `CAR: SFO to Embassy Suites`, `CAR: Palo Alto to SFO`, 
- For [Origin] and [Destination] bias to more glanceable, specific titles, e.g. Airport code (e.g. SFO, YYZ), Hotel Name (e.g. Embassy Suites), short address (44 Montgomery), city (Palo Alto). For travel to and from home office, just put "Palo Alto".  
- Examples: `CAR: SFO to Embassy Suites`, `CAR: Palo Alto to SFO`,
