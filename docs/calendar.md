# Calendar Management 

If you're scheduling time with me, the below outlines the algorithm I try to use for managing meetings. I may delegate scheduling and rescheduling to a member of our team or a bot. 

## General guidelines: 

- Meetings should be scheduled for 25 minutes on weekdays 
- 1:1 meetings with leads should be scheduled for 30 minutes on weekdays and are held weekly
- Skip-level 1:1 meetings should be scheduled for 15 minutes on weekdays and are generally held every 6 months
- The following guidelines on schedule are for San Francisco timezone: 
  - 7am-9am SF time reserved for meetings with attendees outside North America    
  - 9am-1pm SF time is for conventional and standing meetings  
  - 1pm-1:30pm SF time reserved for lunch, but can book over if needed  
  - 2pm-3:30pm SF time reserved for overflow meetings 
  - 3:30pm-5pm SF time reserved for overflow overflow meetings 

Time when not in meetings is for messaging, email, and individual work. 

## Rescheduling 

Sometimes I need to reschedule meetings and below outlines how I try to prioritize rescheduling and whether the rescheduling is done by me ("self-managed") or someone on our team ("delegated").

Reschedule lower level category before rescheduling higher level category.

### Category 5 (rescheduling self-managed) 

- Customers, partners, investors, analysts, advisers, first meetings with referrals from key contacts (Calendar Color: Tomato) 

Avoid rescheduling unless I'm on a plane, in transit or a place that's loud and has poor internet. If we have to reschedule, please ping me so I can write the note myself.
