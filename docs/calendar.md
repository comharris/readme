# CEO Administration Handbook 

The primary purpose of this handbook is to document, analyze and optimize the systems in which CEO tasks are administrated by the support team, specifically executive assistant ("EA") in order for the CEO to provide higher levels of service to the company. 

## Calendar Management 

If you're scheduling time with me, the below outlines the algorithm I try to use for managing meetings. I may delegate scheduling and rescheduling to a member of our team or a bot. 

### General guidelines: 

- Meetings should be scheduled for 25 minutes on weekdays 
- Meetings with partners or managing directors of VC firms should be scheduled for 45 minutes on weekdays
- 1:1 meetings with department heads should be scheduled for 25 minutes on weekdays and are held bi-weekly or weekly
- New department heads should have 1-1s on Mondays and Fridays for 25 minutes for the first 8 weeks 

- The following guidelines on schedule are for San Francisco timezone: 
  - 0700-0830 SF time reserved for meetings with attendees outside North America
    - IMPORTANT: A 0700 or 0730 call is not normal for the CEO and occurs during breakfast with family. The morning of the meeting EA should call or message CEO between 0500 and 0645 to confirm the CEO remembers the meeting. 
  - 0830-0900 SF time reserved for Daily Checkin meeting     
  - 0900-1300 SF time is for conventional and standing meetings  
  - 1300-1303 SF time for lunch, okay to rescheduled but avoid skipping (which can lead to unhealthy snacking)   
  - 1400-1530 SF time for overflow meetings 
  - 1530-1700 SF time for overflow overflow meetings 

Time when not in meetings is for messaging, email, and individual work. 

### Advisers 

CEO meets regularly with advisers (See bios and contacts in [access-controlled database](https://airtable.com/shresRqSDFcqCN6lz)). 

**Note**: Any requests (e.g. interviewing exec candidates, etc.) to advisers other than calendaring should include CEO on CC so that any questions can be quickly answered. 

### Scheduling

Below are guidelines for scheduling and calendaring meetings.

#### External Meetings with Referrals

When the meeting is neither an informational meeting nor a candidate interview, the calendar invitation's subject should include the referral's name, CEO's name, and "Re: Mattermost" (e.g. Joan Thomas-Ian Tien Re: Mattermost). (Calendar Color: Tomato) 

### Rescheduling 

Sometimes I need to reschedule meetings and below outlines how I try to prioritize rescheduling and whether the rescheduling is done by me ("self-managed") or someone on our team ("delegated").

Reschedule lower level category before rescheduling higher level category.

#### Category 5 (rescheduling delegated) 

- IJT Staff Meetings (aka "Leads") 
- Advisers with frequent meetings and expectations of regular cancellations
- Customers, partners, investors, analysts, advisers, first meetings with referrals from key contacts (Calendar Color: Tomato) 

Avoid rescheduling unless I'm on a plane, in transit or a place that's loud and has poor internet. If we have to reschedule, please ping me so I can write the note myself. 

- Customer Obsession Meeting (Calendar Color: Tomato) 

Note: If I can't make the Customer Obsession Meeting, please announce in the channel and delegate running the meeting to Corey or his assign. 

#### Category 4 (rescheduling delegated) 

- IJT Staff Meetings, aka "Leads" (Calendar Color: Banana) 

#### Category 3 (rescheduling delegated) 

- Multi-person meetings with staff and vendors (Calendar Color: Tangerine) 

#### Category 2 (rescheduling delegated) 

- 1-1 meetings with staff and vendors (Calendar Color: Blueberry) 

Note: If 1-1 is weekly or bi-weekly, please cancel, otherwise, reschedule

#### Category 1 (rescheduling self-work) 

- Self-assigned time for work (Calendar Color: Flamingo) 

#### Travel Time (okay to take calls) 

- Time allocated for travel when it's typically okay to take phone calls (Calendar Color: Sage) 

## Travel 

### Booking Travel

#### Air Travel

Guidelines for booking air travel:

- Morning Departures: Flights departing at 6:30am or later are generally OK 
- Evening Arrivals: Aim to have me home to Palo Alto by 6:30pm if possible, or by 8pm at the latest. If home arrival is later than 8pm, push back meetings the next morning to 1.5 hours after waking up following 7.5 hours of sleep.
- Rush Hour: Minimize rush hour travel to and from airport when possible. (Note: Typical rush hour times are 7:00-9:00am and 4:00-6:00pm, Monday through Friday)


### Calendaring Travel

Please calendar car and air travel as follows: 

#### Car Travel - COLOR - Sage  

- From home office to SFO book 50 minutes typically and 90 minutes in rush hour 
- For other drives, please calculate driving distance and add 10 minutes for trips less than 30 minutes and 20 minutes for trips longer than 30 minutes (Note: Need to revise these numbers with data) 

Title: `"CAR: " & [Origin] & " to " & [Destination]`
- Examples: `CAR: SFO to Embassy Suites`, `CAR: Palo Alto to SFO`, 
- For [Origin] and [Destination] bias to more glanceable, specific titles, e.g. Airport code (e.g. SFO, YYZ), Hotel Name (e.g. Embassy Suites), short address (44 Montgomery), city (Palo Alto). For travel to and from home office, just put "Palo Alto".  
- Examples: `CAR: SFO to Embassy Suites`, `CAR: Palo Alto to SFO`, 
Color: SAGE 

#### Air Travel - COLOR: Tomato 
 
Title: `"AIR: " & [Origin] & " to " & [Destination]`
- Examples: `AIR: SFO to SEA`
- Please include confirmation code, flight times, duration and whether Wifi and power would be available (copy and paste from confirmation typically works) 
- Please calendar the specific take-off and landing times into the invite
