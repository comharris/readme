# Calendar Management 

If you're scheduling time with me, the below outlines the algorithm I try to use for managing meetings. I may delegate scheduling and rescheduling to a member of our team or a bot. 

## General guidelines: 

- Meetings should be scheduled for 25 minutes on weekdays 
- 1:1 meetings with leads should be scheduled for 30 minutes on weekdays and are held weekly
- The following guidelines on schedule are for San Francisco timezone: 
  - 7am-9am SF time reserved for meetings with attendees outside North America    
  - 9am-1pm SF time is for conventional and standing meetings  
  - 1pm-1:30pm SF time reserved for lunch, but can book over if needed  
  - 2pm-3:30pm SF time reserved for overflow meetings 
  - 3:30pm-5pm SF time reserved for overflow overflow meetings 

Time when not in meetings is for messaging, email, and individual work. 

## Rescheduling 

Sometimes I need to reschedule meetings and below outlines how I try to prioritize rescheduling and whether the rescheduling is done by me ("self-managed") or someone on our team ("delegated").

Reschedule lower level category before rescheduling higher level category.

## Category 5 (rescheduling self-managed) 

- Customers, partners, investors, analysts, advisers 

Avoid rescheduling unless I'm on a plane, in transit or a place that's loud and has poor internet. If we have to reschedule, please ping me so I can write the note myself. 

## Category 4 (rescheduling delegated) 

- IJT Staff Meetings (aka "Leads") 

## Category 3 (announcement of non-attendance delegated) 

- Meetings where my attendance is optional 
- Customer Obsession Meeting 

Note: If I can't make the Customer Obsession Meeting, please announce in the channel and delegate running the meeting to Corey or his assign. 

## Category 2 (rescheduling delegated) 

- Multi-person meetings with staff and vendors 

## Category 1 (rescheduling delegated) 

- 1-1 meetings with staff and vendors 

Note: If 1-1 is weekly or bi-weekly, please cancel, otherwise, reschedule
