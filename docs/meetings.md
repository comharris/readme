# Meetings

## MLT Daily 

The purpose of MLT Daily is to keep our team in sync and accountable.

In MLT Daily we can share: 

- **Heads-Up** - Share priority info, e.g. PR issue, customer escalation, product schedule change, etc.
- **FYI** - Top FYIs for yesterday or today, e.g. key hire starting, handling escalation, notes from important meeting, etc. 
- **Asks** - Ask MLT members for things, e.g. need to escalate issue, ask for update, headcount plan past due, etc.  

### Process

#### Stand-Up Post

Before meeting use `/standup` command to post updates to peers in the channel of what's important. If you post incorrectly, use the "Edit" option to update. 

Most updates will look something like this:
