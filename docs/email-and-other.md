## Email Management

### Queries from potential new investors 

#### Cold new investor queries 

When receiving repeated cold investor email queries from the same person, often an analyst, CEO may forward EA the mail with "LNI" short for "List of New Investors", which indicates that EA should loop in, thank them for their time and let the investor know we'll add them to the [list of funds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E9ks7mXmQBxrxvzGbL530bA5AzLHFiz5iq-hldaVc3Q/edit#gid=0) to contact in our next capital raise (bcc CEO).  

#### Warm / informed new investor queries 

When an investor queries comes from a warm intro, or is someone who appears highly informed about our space (Open source, Team Collaboration, DevOps / InfoSec, etc.) CEO may loop in and suggest 25m Zoom or phone meeting.  

### Vendor Requests

Vendors we pay will sometimes reach out directly to CEO for payment. CEO may forward EA the mail with "UPI" short for "Update Payment Information", which indicates that EA should loop in, share contact information for payment team (payments@mattermost.com), and share instructions for invoicing ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#heading=h.ispv9ka8whak))(bcc CEO).

### Recommendations

When sharing recommendations for CEO decisions (e.g. signatures), indicate your level of confidence or attachment to the outcome by adding x/5 ([0/5, 1/5...5/5](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#id8)) to the email's subject line. Add the x/5 as the first item in the subject line so that it is easily readable on a mobile phone. Please also add the x/5 to the email's body.

## Other Tasks

### Ordering Meals

For food ordered in (such as during an all day meeting), choose foods that are low carb, low sugar, non-spicy; fat is okay. 

- OK: Chicken or duck salad with oil and vinegar/citrus (no croutons), vegetarian meals with protien substitute.
- Avoid: Spicy food, thick-sliced bread, food that needs heating, food that can be spilled
