# CEO Interview Pre-reading 

Hi there, 

My name is Ian and I'm CEO of Mattermost, Inc. and a co-creator of the Mattermost open source project. 

Thank you for investing the time in getting to know our company and for being open to the potential of building this company together. When we speak, I'm interested in understanding one thing: Is Mattermost a place where you can do the best work of your career? 

This means understanding a) who you are, b) what skills and accomplishments you're interested in developing and c) exploring the possibilities of what Mattermost might offer you to succeed beyond all expectations.

Our recruiting process is focused on answering these questions, and in our upcoming meeting I hope we can learn more about each other and the possibilities ahead. 

You can learn more about our company at: https://mattermost.com/about-us/

You can learn more about me and my approach to leading our teams here: https://it33.github.io/readme/

Because our time is limited, I would ask your help in answering a few questions ahead of our meeting that I can review in preparation for our discussion, per the link here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGFUN7baIFot6me_oDWTSICA_QhRFM9dBRiqBTw38uRY6XDQ/viewform

In the survey, there's a section to ask questions, and I'm excited to answer whatever you'd like to talk about, 

Looking forward to speaking to you soon, 

Ian
