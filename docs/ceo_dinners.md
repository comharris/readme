# CEOs, Founders & Friends Dinners

Musicians hang out with musicians, writers hang out with writers, and as a founding CEO I put together modest dinner parties with fellow CEOs, founders and other friends to hang out and talk shop. It's drinks and food, talking shop (culture, business, hiring, fundraising, vendors, etc.), and developing a community of peers who can help each other professionally and personally, as musicians or writers might do. 

These are typically co-hosted by my good friend (and investor/board member), Shvet Jain, and we have them at a penthouse turned VC office in the South Park area in San Francisco. 

- Drinks start around 5:30pm, DoorDash arrives around 6:30pm and we have veggie and non-veggie options. 
- Invitees get a calendar invite from either me or "Camille" with the street address for the dinner. 
- My mobile phone number comes in the invite to help with directions. 

The only ask I have is that if you do decide to come that you try to arrive between 5:30pm and 6:30pm, so we can get all the intros done at the beginning.
