# How I think and behave

Here's a primer on what goes through my head most of the time and how it leads to my actions.
 
## A) How I think 

Here's some basic things to know about working with me: 

### 1. Most things are 1 or 0 to me.

Either things are correct and excellent and as they should be (a "1"), or things are wrong and need to be fixed or de-prioritized (a "0"). It's difficult for me to conceive of answers "in between". I tend to agree, disagree, or need more information. My views are in context, something that's a "1" for one use case or a certain level of performance, and a "0" in another and vice versa. 

### 2. I'm influenced by facts, data and new perspectives.

If you show me facts, data or a framing that brings me to a different conclusion, I can change my view on something quickly. I work best with people who are comfortable having a dialog. I welcome [answer-first communications](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7) (what McKinsey calls "pyramid principle") as it's typically the most effective way to influence me. 

### 3. I'm an extrovert.

My energy increases when I'm communicating with other people (including on video calls, via messaging and in person). When I am working alone for long periods of time, my energy decreases. Depending on the mix of introverts and extroverts in a conversation, I try to adjust my style to make the most of our time together.

### 4. I think in systems.

In my mind, software, businesses, art, music and people are all systems. Each has their history, parameters, dynamics and opportunities. Understanding history and current state informs the future. The song [the Hook](http://www.avclub.com/article/why-hook-by-blues-traveler-is-actually-a-pretty-ge-83392) by Blues Traveller is a wonderful example of understanding music as a system. 

### 5. I aspire to be logical, while acknowledging that human thinking is largely emotional.

In university I studied cognition and built software simulating different models of thinking (rules-based, pattern-based, dynamic/chaotic systems, etc.). I believe emotions help us arrive quickly at potential solutions, and once delivered logic must vet our analysis and conclusion. If I have a strong first impression about something (good or bad), I try to not let it over influence my final decision. 

## B) How I behave

Here are some things to know about me in special situations: 

### 1. Sometimes I ask a series of precise, close-ended questions.

When discussing something important, I ask very specific questions like: "How long has the regression been known to exist in the product?", "Who's responsible for replying to the contributor?", "When was the last time that person replied to any contributor?" This line of questions may seem uncomfortable to some people who prefer a more casual style of conversation. Please understand I have no intention of treating people differently, I am just trying to understand facts quickly. 

### 2. When exploring ideas, I consider multiple possibilities at the same time.

As brainstorming discussions seem to converge on a path, I may start asking questions in the opposite direction to see if the consensus falls apart, or if other paths are properly eliminated and we end up at the same conclusion. I may ask questions down paths others feel should be eliminated earlier because I find sometimes those questions uncover new paths not considered. That said, once we have agreement, I am 100% behind the direction and will repeated it endlessly.

### 3. If you're not a native English speaker, I'm happy to speak slower and more simply. Please signal to me to do this.

Signalling me with a facial expression or just letting me know if I'm difficult to understand is highly appreciated. I know how you feel. In addition to English, I speak conversational Mandarin in an accent that can make me sound more fluent than I am. I struggle when a native speaker uses advanced vocabulary.

## C) Tips on working with me

### 1. I value your recommendation over equal options 

I think in "Yes" and "No". If you are seeking feedback from me on multiple options, please select one to be the "recommendation" and other options as "also considered", even if you aren't sure which is the best option. This lets me share a "Yes", "No", or "I don't know" with you quickly and open the conversation to other options as needed. Please AVOID sending me "equal options" and hiding your opinion, as my Yes/No brain will consider the first option you present as your recommendation and if it's not, we'll have bad data mixed into our discussion. 

### 2. Earning trust is better than asking for trust

When I have questions on status and the response is something like "everything is okay, trust me" I get worried. My mental model is someone who has things under control is eager to openly share, dive into detail and talk about risks and key decisions in a process that is otherwise under control. When things aren't under control, discussions don't go into detail, and there's a lack of critique and constructive discussion. 

If I'm wrong, and things are headed for a good outcome, and easy way to flip me is a note like: 

- "Our key risks as [X] and our mitigations are [Y], here's a link to how I've communicated to our team about the project (it's in the weeds). I've queued a discussion for [Y] meeting, let me know if you want to meet before." 

Feedback like "I've done this before, don't worry" and "he's doing great, trust me" worries me. 

### 3. When I'm in learning mode, please anticipate Precision Question and Answers (PQ&A) 

PQ&A is a technique to quickly understand what we know as an organization by asking a series of specific, closed ended questions. E.g. What is the definition of X? What was X last month versus this month? How did we measure X? How is X calculated in case B? 

PQ&A continues until someone either says "I don't know" (a good result, defining the boundaries of our understanding) or leaves PQ&A incomplete. While PQ&A is a highly effective way to exchange information, it can be uncomfortable for people who aren't familiar with the method, so we should use it carefully until people are ready for it. 

### 4. When things don't go as planned, please teach me about specifically a) what happened, b) how we'll avoid this issue in future

There's nothing wrong with occassional failures--and we actually want _some_ failures happening all the time so we know we're exploring, growing and pushing into the unknown. When something breaks, we need to rebuild it stronger so it won't break the next time. This means doing root cause analysis and teaching others, and me, what went wrong and how we prevent the issue in future. When something fails the basic answer I am looking for is something like "This failed because we have Process A and on step 4 and 6 we had X go wrong. We've fixed the process to avoid X, and also problems Y and Z which are akin to X." 

An outstanding answer would add detail one level lower, such as 

1) "The error caused an incorrect reading of 234 instead of 124, here is a spreadsheet with formulas showing the correct calculation with steps 4 and 6 highlighted in Process A", or 

2) "Here is a link to the updated documentation that should fix our process in future". 

When something has failed, please AVOID answers like "Don't worry about it, it's fixed now" as my Yes/No brain will assume the lack of detail, teaching and remediation signals a lack of understanding. 

### 5. Prioritize the work over being liked  

When working in teams, don't optimize for how you believe you will be perceived. Don't prioritize being liked over making the right decision. Hold the work up above all else. Great organizations will respect that. Leaders who care too much about being liked set a bad example.

## D) Systems I use 

### 1. Structure organizations for unbiased oversight when practical 

Some functions provide natural oversight to others. For example: Quality assurance provides oversight to engineering while legal and finance provide oversight to sales. When practical, avoid having the function providing oversight report into the function receiving it. Regardless of our good intentions, the reporting structure creates bias. As the saying goes: "who's bread I eat, her song I sing".
