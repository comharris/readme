# WIP: Reasoning 

People reason in different ways. Below are my notes on how I try to adapt my reasoning to best understand how others are thinking and how I naturally think. This isn't based on any peer-reviewed research, it's just a personal model I'm using and tweaking. 

## Different ways to reason 

When I'm talking to someone I try to get a sense of how they think so I can a) more quickly understand them and b) share back my thoughts in a way that's easy for them to absorb. Here are some of the styles I've noticed: 

### Story and analogy 

Use stories with beginnings, middles and ends that people use to map to different situations as analogies. 

### Simple Logic

Boil things down to plain spoken talking points. 

### Comparables 

Show examples of success and failure in other situations and map those into current situation.

### Experience 

Map examples of past personal experiences into current experience. 

### Gut 

Trust subconscious "feelings" to provide guidance. 

### Detailed Logic 

Lay out a detailed set of facts and talk through logic 

### Mid-Game

Lay out multiple paths and futures and focus on the best decision for the near and middle term. Often using data, facts and reasoning. 

### End-Game

Consider multiple futures near and long term and extrapolate current decisions to possible future outcomes. 

## I'm an end-game thinker 

My mind is a natural time machine. I project facts and patterns today months and years in the future. I make decisions as if I'm going "back in time" and can change the past know what might happen next.
