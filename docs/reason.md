# WIP: Reasoning 

People reason in different ways. Below are my notes on how I try to adapt my reasoning to best understand how others are thinking and how I naturally think. This isn't based on any objective research, it's just a personal model I'm using and tweaking. 

## Different ways to reason 

When I'm talking to someone I try to get a sense of how they think so I can a) more quickly understand them and b) share back my thoughts in a way that's easy for them to absorb. Below is a list of the different styles in my mind. 

If you've read this part of my README, feel free to let me know how you prefer to reason and I'll try to adapt--and if you're not sure, please don't worry. All the ways to reason are valid and can be high functioning.  

### Story and analogy 

Use stories with beginnings, middles and ends that people use to map to different situations as analogies. 

### Simple Logic

Boil things down to plain spoken talking points. 

### Comparables 

Show examples of success and failure in other situations and map those into current situation.

### Experience 

Map examples of past personal experiences into current experience. 

### Gut 

Trust subconscious "feelings" to provide guidance. 

### Detailed Logic 

Lay out a detailed set of facts and talk through logic 

### Mid-Game

Lay out multiple paths and futures and focus on the best decision for the near and middle term. Often using data, facts and reasoning. 

### End-Game

Consider multiple futures near and long term and extrapolate current decisions to possible future outcomes. 

## I'm an end-game thinker 

My mind is a natural time machine. I project facts and patterns today months and years in the future. I make decisions as if I'm going "back in time" and can change the past know what might happen next. 

If we are headed towards a good decision, I see the benefits months and years out. If we're headed to a borderline decision or process, I see the impact ten-fold and a hundred-fold, and I'll focus a lot on taking something borderline and making it very solid.
