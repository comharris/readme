# Guide to interviewing at Mattermost 

All Mattermosters are ambassadors and guardians of our culture, and Interviewers are our "best of the best". The following guide shares  the principles, process and criteria under which Mattermost conducts its interviews for candidates and our company to mutually assess the fit with each other. 

## Interviewers

During the recruiting process, candidates and Mattermost are assessing each other at the same time. It's vital that Mattermost interviewers both represent our culture and people accurately and precisely assess the candidate's fit for our culture. 

We invest in training and developing the skills of our interviewers through a series of skill levels. 

### Interviewer Skill Levels 

#### Level 0 Interviewer 

- **Scope:** New to interviewing at Mattermost - Feedback should not significantly impact candidate assessments.
- **Assessment:** Documents strengths and opportunities with specific examples, but may miss issues trained interviewers detect.   
- **Recruiting:** Represents Mattermost as a potential colleague exhibiting cultural norms and proficiencies.

#### Level 1 Interviewer 

Accuracy of candidate assessments should be above 85 percent (i.e. less than 15% chance they've missed something in area interviewed). 

- **Scope:** 50m interviews for junior to intermediate candidates. Asked to assess specific capabilities or leadership principles.
- **Assessment:** Catches obvious misalignment. Effectively documents strengths and opportunities for hiring committee.
- **Recruiting:** Outstanding colleage. Makes candidates want to work with the interviewer in future. 

Examples: Colleagues who have completed interviewer training and have exceeded 20 to 30 interviews with time for reflection and feedback. 

#### Level 2 Interviewer

Accuracy of candidate assessments should be above 90 percent (i.e. less than 10% chance they've missed something in area interviewed). 

- **Scope:** 50m interviews for junior to senior candidates with or without guidance.
- **Assessment:** Catches hard-to-spot show-stopper issues. Written feedback is concise, precise and thorough.  
- **Recruiting:** Talent magnet. Makes candidates eagar to join the company, not just the leader.

Examples: Experienced directors, senior managers, leads and ICs 

#### Level 3 Interviewer 

Accuracy of candidate assessments should be in high-90s (i.e. less than single-digit percent chance they've missed something in area interviewed). 

- **Scope:** 25m to 50m interviews for junior to exec-level candidates with or without guidance.
- **Assessment:** Accurately and concisely assess candidate across broad and deep competencies.  
- **Recruiting:** Talent gravity well. Candidates sees Mattermost opportunity in a compelling new light. 

Examples: Executives, founders, C-suite advisers

### Interviewer training and development 

Mattermost as a company is in the process of formalizing its interviewer training process. Right now, staff members working with their managers may either volunteer or be referred into an interviewer training process managed by PeopleOps, depending on need and capacity. In general, interviewers should have at least 1 to 2 years of experience working at Mattermost before interviewing. 

The process involves staff members reading this guide thoroughly and working with a Level 2 interviewer or higher to estimate the staff member's a) current proficiency in assessment and recruiting, b) opportunities to grow, c) path to development, which may include mock-interviews, online or in-class training, or participation in junior-level interviews. 

## Principles 

### Be our best 

Interviewers need to be "the best of our best" in terms of their ability to assess and recruit candidates. While this can be challenging since our best people are often extremely busy, it's vital to a) keep our best people engaged in the interview process, b) ensuring hiring managers have access to the best feedback from interviewers as possible to make the best decisions. 

### No "shoe-ins" 

While we immensely value referrals, we should run a competitive process for every role. It helps ensure we get the best people and it's more fair to the person joining, because their colleagues will be confident they went through a full vetting process. Exceptions can be made with written sign-off from CEO for either exceptional candidates or very difficult to fill roles.

## Recruiting Process

The following steps outline the recruiting process. At any point, the process may be discontinued if it's found the candidate is unlikely to be successful near and long term at Mattermost. 

### Posting Process

1. Roles should be posted by recruiters with responsibilites and requirements clearly defined. 
- Each role has an "interview plan" devised by the hiring manager and recruiter that provides guidance to interviewers on the areas to cover and sequence of interviews. 

### Screening Process

1. Recruiters should screen applicants based on publicly listed requirements 
- Promising candidates should be screened by the recruiter for basic culture and workstyle alignment

### Interview Process 

1. The interview process should be scheduled by the recruiter based on the interview plan prepared with the hiring manager. 

### Interview Areas and Area Assignments 

In general, we have "areas" to be assessed during the interview process that are grouped into four categories: 

- **Capabilities** (typically 4-8 areas) - Evaluated by colleages with expertise in the discipline we're hiring for, or working with experts in the discipline 
- **Culture** (6 areas) - Understanding a candidate's alignment with Mattermost Leadership Principles  
- **Chemistry** (implicitly assessed) - Poor chemistry is a reason to stop the process. Good chemistry should be neutral, never a reason to hire. 
- **Workstyle** (2 areas to assess) - Estimating how well a candidate will work in our environment. Typically assessed by recruiters or hiring managers. 

Each interviewer should be able to cover 3 to 6 areas depending on the skill of the interviewer and scope of each area. Recruiters or hiring managers assign categories and segments to each interviewer. 

For example, for a product manager role, the hiring manager may work with the recruiter to assign the following areas: 

- Recruiter: Workstyle (distributed work, open source work) 
- Interviewer A: Capabilities (requirements gathering, data-driven experimentation and validation), Leadership Principles (Insist on High Standards, High Impact)  
- Interviewer B: Capabilities (feature design, prioritization), Leadership Principles (Be and Owner, Customer Obsession) 
- Interviewer C: Capabilities (leadership, documentation, product marketing support), Leadership Principles, (Self-Awareness, Earn Trust)

The interview plan should be posted in Lever by the recruiter at the start of the interview with `@mentions` to each interviewer so they know which area to cover. 

#### Capabilities 

Each role should have roughly 4 to 8 areas of responsibility, which we refer to as "capabilities", to be assessed based on the publicly-posted job description. 

For example, for a [Software Design Engineer II](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/developer.html#software-design-engineer-ii) the responsibilities include:  

```
- Designs, leads and delivers high impact features and changes across the product stack and test automation infrastructure. 
- Sets thoughtful, technical vision for areas of ownership, balancing functional and technical trade-offs, while working effectively with PM and UX. 
- Drops fluidly into different projects, ramps quickly and leads features to successful outcomes. 
- Inspires, organizes and enables groups of open source community members to contribute to development campaigns in building significant new functionality.
```

When interviewing, a hiring manager should work with the recruiter to divide the capability interviews among staff members qualified to assess each area. In some cases a requirement may be multiple areas. For example, `Sets thoughtful, technical vision for areas of ownership, balancing functional and technical trade-offs, while working effectively with PM and UX.` might break into three areas, a) `Sets thoughtful, technical vision for areas of ownership`, b) `balancing functional and technical trade-offs`, c) `working effectively with PM and UX`. 

For each area, interviewers should approach candidates with a friendly curiosity to learn about the candidate's depth of experience, breadth of perspective, and to uncover potential gaps and blindspots. Some examples of questions might be: 

1. How do you approach X? 
- Can you share an example of a difficult decision while you were doing X? 
- How would you teach a junior person how do X? 
- If you were leading a team with multiple people with your same skillset and role, what would you do yourself and what would you delegate? 
- Can you share a story about making a mistake while doing X? What did you learn? How would you change your behavior in future? 

##### Scoring Capabilities 

Scores for each capability area should be on a scale of 1 to 5: 

- 1 - Underqualified - Not an area of significant existing skill 
- 2 - Low - Skill is below target level     
- 3 - On Target - Skill is at or above target 
- 4 - Strong - Skill is at upper end of target level, but doesn't pass into next level 
- 5 - Overqualified - Skill exceeds level for the role to the point where candidate is mis-leveled (e.g. an intermediate-level candidate with senior-level proficiency in their area) 

Level 1 interviewers and higher should enter their score per area into Level comments

#### Culture 

Cultural fit for Mattermost is based on alignment to leadership principles. Unlike capabilities, which can sometimes be rapidly improved over time, cultural fit can be difficult to change, and also difficult to assess. 

Paying close attention to cultural fit during the interview process is vital. 


##### Leadership Principles  

The following summarizes leadership principles on which candidates should be assessed. 

###### Customer Obsession 

- Naturally curious about customer's challenges and their world  

Customer-facing Roles: 
- Naturally curious about customer's challenges and their world  
- Empathetic, respectful, thoughtful
- Obviously someone we'd feel comfortable presenting to customer. 

Product and Engineering Roles: 
- Frames their work in the context of end goals and benefits to customers 

###### Be an Owner 

- Owns outcomes - Doesn’t drop the ball, jumps-in when something important is needed and never says “it’s not my job.”
- Accountable - Open about their mistakes, doesn't "sugar coat", doesn't blame others 
- Growth mindset - Uses mistakes to change and permanently improve, focuses on future improvements over blaming others  

###### High Impact

##### Scoring Leadership Principles  

The scoring of leadership principles should be as follows: 

- 1 - Underqualified - Not a culture fit in this area  
- 2 - Low - Fit is below target level     
- 3 - On Target - Fit is at or above target 
- 4 - Strong - Fit is at upper end of target level, but doesn't pass into next level 
- 5 - Overqualified - Fit exceeds level for the role to the point where candidate is mis-leveled (e.g. an intermediate-level candidate with senior-level proficiency in their area) 

#### Workstyle 

Workstyle should be assessed formally by either the recruiter or the hiring manager. During the interview process, as interviewers learn more about the day-to-day style and preferences of the candidate, they should raise yellow or red flags in Lever notes if workstyle may be an issue. 

For example, if an interviewer learns that someone who's going to work from a home office talks about how they've repeatedly failed to be successful in that environment in the past due to lack of supervision--despite the fact they told the recruiter that they love the environment.  
 
##### Distributed workstyle 

Assess the candidate's proficiency in working in distributed organizations. How self-motivated are they? How strong is their written communication? What are their past successes and failures working in distributed environments? 
 
##### Open source workstyle 

To what extent have they contributed to open source projects? How comfortable are they with working online and in public? What are their successes and failures working in open source communities? 

### Interview Meeting Checklist 

Each interviewer should meet candidates over Zoom for interview meetings. Interviewers should be on-time and in a quiet place that has a strong internet connection. The checklist for conducting an interview is as follows: 

#### 0:00 - Introduction 

- Greet the candidate.
- Share some information about your role and yourself. 
- Share the following with the candidate (which they may have heard before, but it's fine to repeat 20 to 30 seconds of commentary): 
  - During the conversation, the interviewer will be typing to take notes 
  - There will be time for questions towards the end of the time, though the candidate should feel free to ask questions during the conversation
  - The interview will last about 50 minutes, and 10 minutes at the end to write feedback 
  - The recruiter will be in touch with next steps

#### 0:03 - Interviewing 

- Have a conversation with the candidate to assess their fit
- Take notes during the conversation 
- If you were assigned areas by the recruiter or hiring manager make sure to include those areas in your written feedback 
- Document "Red Flags", which may be show-stoppers, e.g. poor judgement, presenting misleading data, past issue with integrity, etc. 
- Document "Yellow Flags", subtle one-time mis-steps, e.g. poor interview behavior. If these issues repeat, escalate to Red Flag.
- Document "Sparkles", if a junior candidate surprises you with an insight, note this. Two sparkes is a very strong positive sign. 

#### 0:40 to 0:45 - Open for questions from candidate 

- When you have around 5 to 10 minutes remaining, ask the candidate if they have any questions
- If candidates ask for your assessment of them, you can share your high level observations, but refrain from sharing whether you are leaning towards a `Yes` or a `No` recommendation. That decision should be made after the interview as you reflect on your notes.  
- If they don't have any questions, or when the time is done, thank them for their time and leave the Zoom meeting 

#### 0:50 - Conclude interview, write feedback 
- Conclude the interview after 50 minutes.
- Spend the final 10 minutes consolidating your feedback into Lever as a comment with an `@mention` to the hiring manager.
 - In your first sentence include an `@mention` to the hiring manager and whether you feel the candidate is a hire.
 - If you believe the candidate is a strong fit based on the areas you explored click the `THUMBS UP` control
 - If you're not sure, or if you don't believe the candidate is a fit, use the `THUMBS DOWN` button. 
 - DO NOT leave the recommendation blank. If you're not sure, it's `THUMBS DOWN`. 

Example of feedback: 

```
@jane.smith I'm a hire on Bobby Droptables: 

Strengths: 
- Experienced and comfortable balancing functional and technical trade-offs 
- Strong empathy across dev, PM, UX and customers, with good attention to detail 
- Very solid on customer obsessions, constantly refers back to stories and examples

Opportunities:

(2) Sets thoughtful, technical vision for areas of ownership
(3) balancing functional and technical trade-offs
(3) working effectively with PM and UX
(4) Customer Obsession
