# Interviewing at Mattermost 

All Mattermosters are ambassadors and guardians of our culture. Interviewers are expected our "best of the best". The following guide shares the principles, criteria and standards under which Mattermost conducts its interviews to assess the fit of potential new hires. 

## Interviewer Levels 

During the recruiting process, candidates and Mattermost are assessing each other at the same time. It's vital that Mattermost interviewers both represent our culture and people accurately and precisely assess the candidate's fit for our culture. 

We invest in training and developing the skills of our interviewers through a series of skill levels: 

### Level 0 Interviewer 

- **Scope:** New to interviewing at Mattermost - Feedback should not significantly impact candidate assessments.
- **Skill:** Documents strengths and opportunities with specific examples, but may miss issues trained interviewers detect.   
- **Representation:** Represents Mattermost as a potential colleague exhibiting cultural norms and proficiencies.

### Level 1 Interviewer 

Accuracy of candidate assessments should be above 85 percent (i.e. less than 15% chance they've missed something in area interviewed). 

- **Scope:** 50m interviews for junior to intermediate candidates. Asked to assess specific capabilities or leadership principles.
- **Skill:** Catches obvious misalignment. Effectively documents strengths and opportunities for hiring committee.
- **Representation:** Outstanding colleage. Makes candidates want to work with the interviewer in future. 

### Level 2 Interviewer

Accuracy of candidate assessments should be above 90 percent (i.e. less than 10% chance they've missed something in area interviewed). 

- **Scope:** 50m interviews for junior to senior candidates with or without guidance.
- **Skill:** Catches hard-to-spot show-stopper issues. Written feedback is concise, precise and thorough.  
- **Representation:** Talent magnet. Makes candidates eagar to join the company, not just the leader.

### Level 3 Interviewer 

Accuracy of candidate assessments should be in high-90s (i.e. less than single-digit percent chance they've missed something in area interviewed). 

- **Scope:** 25m interviews for junior to exec-level candidates with or without guidance.
- **Skill:** Accurately and concisely assess candidate across broad and deep competencies.  
- **Representation:** Talent gravity well. Candidates sees Mattermost opportunity in a compelling new light. 

## Principles 

### No "shoe-ins" 

While we immensely value referrals, we should run a competitive process for every role. It helps ensure we get the best people and it's more fair to the person joining, because their colleagues will be confident they went through a full vetting process. Exceptions can be made with written sign-off from CEO for either exceptional candidates or very difficult to fill roles.

## Interview Process 

Each role has an "interview plan" devised by the hiring manager and recruiter that provides guidance to interviewers on the areas to cover and sequence of interviews. 

### Interview Areas and Area Assignments 

In general, we interview based on "areas" grouped into three categories: 

- Capabilities (typically 5-8 areas) - Evaluated by colleages with expertise in the discipline we're hiring for, or working with experts in the discipline 
- Leadership Principles (6 areas to assess) - Understanding a candidate's comfort with Mattermost Leadership Principles  
- Workstyle (2 areas to assess) - Estimating how well a candidate will work in our environment 

Interviewers should be able to cover 3 to 6 areas depending on the skill of the interviewer and scope of each area. Recruiters or hiring managers assign categories and segments to each interviewer. 

For example, for a product manager role, the hiring manager may work with the recruiter to assign the following areas: 

- Recruiter: Workstyle (distributed work, open source work) 
- Interviewer A: Capabilities (requirements gathering, data-driven experimentation and validation), Leadership Principles (Insist on High Standards, High Impact)  
- Interviewer B: Capabilities (feature design, prioritization), Leadership Principles (Be and Owner, Customer Obsession) 
- Interviewer C: Capabilities (leadership, documentation, product marketing support), Leadership Principles, (Self-Awareness, Earn Trust)

The interview plan should be posted in Lever by the recruiter at the start of the interview. 

#### Capabilities 

`- Develop a deep understanding of customer needs, and use it to shape product roadmap and team objectives`

How would you teach a junior person how do X? 
If you were leading a team with multiple people with your same skillset and role, what would you do yourself and what would you delegate? 
Can you share a story about making a mistake while doing X? What did you learn? How would you change your behavior in future?

### Interview Meeting Checklist 

Each interviewer should meet candidates over Zoom for interview meetings. Interviewers should be on-time and in a quiet place that has a strong internet connection. The checklist for conducting an interview is as follows: 

#### 0:00 - Introduction 

- Greet the candidate.
- Share some information about your role and yourself. 
- Share the following with the candidate (which they may have heard before, but it's fine to repeat 20 to 30 seconds of commentary): 
  - During the conversation, the interviewer will be typing to take notes 
  - There will be time for questions towards the end of the time, though the candidate should feel free to ask questions during the conversation
  - The interview will last about 50 minutes, and 10 minutes at the end to write feedback 
  - The recruiter will be in touch with next steps

#### 0:03 - Interviewing 

- Have a conversation with the candidate to assess their fit
- Take notes during the conversation 
- If you were assigned areas by the recruiter or hiring manager make sure to include those areas in your written feedback 
- Document "Red Flags", which may be show-stoppers, e.g. poor judgement, presenting misleading data, past issue with integrity, etc. 
- Document "Yellow Flags", subtle one-time mis-steps, e.g. poor interview behavior. If these issues repeat, escalate to Red Flag.
- Document "Sparkles", if a junior candidate surprises you with an insight, note this. Two sparkes is a very strong positive sign. 

#### 0:40 to 0:45 - Open for questions from candidate 

- When you have around 5 to 10 minutes remaining, ask the candidate if they have any questions
- If candidates ask for your assessment of them, you can share your high level observations, but refrain from sharing whether you are leaning towards a `Yes` or a `No` recommendation. That decision should be made after the interview as you reflect on your notes.  
- If they don't have any questions, or when the time is done, thank them for their time and leave the Zoom meeting 

#### 0:50 - Conclude interview, write feedback 
- Conclude the interview after 50 minutes.
- Spend the final 10 minutes consolidating your feedback into Lever as a comment with an `@mention` to the hiring manager.
 - In your first sentence include an `@mention` to the hiring manager and whether you feel the candidate is a hire.
 - If you believe the candidate is a strong fit based on the areas you explored click the `THUMBS UP` control
 - If you're not sure, or if you don't believe the candidate is a fit, use the `THUMBS DOWN` button. 
 - DO NOT leave the recommendation blank. If you're not sure, it's `THUMBS DOWN`. 

#### Post-interview 

- If the candidate sends you a thank you note, respond to it the same day and CC the recruiter.
