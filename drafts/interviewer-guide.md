# Interviewing at Mattermost 

## Interviewers are "the best of the best" 

All Mattermosters are ambassadors and protectors of our culture and interviewers are expected to be "the best of the best" in those tasks.


## Principles 

### No "shoe-ins" 

While we immensely value referrals, we should run a competitive process for every role. It helps ensure we get the best people and it's more fair to the person joining, because their colleagues will be confident they went through a full vetting process. Exceptions can be made with written sign-off from CEO for either exceptional candidates or very difficult to fill roles.

## Interviewer Guide  

### Customer Obsession 

- Naturally curious about customer's challenges and their world  

Customer-facing Roles: 
- Naturally curious about customer's challenges and their world  
- Empathetic, respectful, thoughtful
- Obviously someone we'd feel comfortable presenting to customer. 

Product and Engineering Roles: 
- Frames their work in the context of end goals and benefits to customers 

### Be an Owner 

- Owns outcomes - Doesn’t drop the ball, jumps-in when something important is needed and never says “it’s not my job.”
- Accountable - Open about their mistakes, doesn't "sugar coat", doesn't blame others 
- Growth mindset - Uses mistakes to change and permanently improve, focuses on future improvements over blaming others
