# Interviewing at Mattermost 

All Mattermosters are ambassadors and guardians of our culture. Interviewers are expected our "best of the best". The following guide shares the principles, criteria and standards under which Mattermost conducts its interviews to assess the fit of potential new hires. 

## Interviewer Levels 

During the recruiting process, candidates and Mattermost are assessing each other at the same time. It's vital that Mattermost interviewers both represent our culture and people accurately and precisely assess the candidate's fit for our culture. 

We invest in training and developing the skills of our interviewers through a series of skill levels: 

### Level 0 Interviewer 

- **Scope:** New to interviewing at Mattermost - Feedback should not significantly impact candidate assessments.
- **Skill:** Documents strengths and opportunities but may miss misalignment trained interviewers detect.   
- **Representation:** Represents Mattermost as a potential colleague exhibiting cultural norms and proficiencies.

### Level 1 Interviewer 

- **Scope:** 60m interviews for junior to intermediate candidates. Asked to assess specific capabilities or leadership principles.
- **Skill:** Catches obvious misalignment. Effectively documents strengths and opportunities for hiring committee.
- **Representation:** Outstanding colleage. Makes candidates want to work with the interviewer on a future project. 

### Level 2 Interviewer

- **Scope:** 50m interviews for junior to senior candidates with or without guidance.
- **Skill:** Catches hard-to-spot show-stopper issues. Written feedback is concise, precise and thorough.  
- **Representation:** Talent magnet. Makes candidates want to join the company, not just the leader.

### Level 3 Interviewer 

- **Scope:** 30-45m interviews for junior to exec-level candidates with or without guidance.
- **Skill:** Accurately and concisely assess candidate across broad and deep competencies.  
- **Representation:** Talent gravity well. Candidates sees Mattermost opportunity in a new light. 

## Principles 

### No "shoe-ins" 

While we immensely value referrals, we should run a competitive process for every role. It helps ensure we get the best people and it's more fair to the person joining, because their colleagues will be confident they went through a full vetting process. Exceptions can be made with written sign-off from CEO for either exceptional candidates or very difficult to fill roles.
