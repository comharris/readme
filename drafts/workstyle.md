# WIP - Mattermost the Company  

Mattermost is an open source, remote-first, communities-centered company based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet. 

**Open source** means by default we make our technology, business process and source code available to the public, while maintaining a minority portion as propreitary technology, built on our open source work, to license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source work to be produced. We believe technology for good is technology for all and the intention of our model is to accelerate the development of quality of security-conscious, open source solutions in the world. 

**Remote-first** means by default our staff works anywhere in the world where a) we have support for quality video calling and b) where we're legally allowed. Mattermost was born in an extraordinary age where organizations can attract, hire and enable remote teams--working out of homes coffee shops and co-working spaces across timezones--to produce faster, better technology and business results than purely office-based teams. For a minority of roles, we may prioritize or constrain geographies due to business needs.

Remote-first culture flourishes when we share one simple principle: **Courtesy**. Courtesy means Mattermosters are thoughtful about keeping our communities appropriately informed, following etiquette for discussions, calls and video meetings, and giving and receiving feedback on how to work better together. 

**Communities-centered** means we define our success in the context of the success of our [communities](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html): users, customers, implementers, resellers, technology partners, contributors, and colleagues. The success of each community is owned by a member of the Mattermost leadership team. The plural definition of "communities" is intended to remind us of the diversity of needs across our stakeholders, particularly those downstream from the software development process who deploy, use and build businesses around our technology. 

**Based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet** means the mailing address for Mattermost, Inc. is in Palo Alto, California, and our headquarters is on the internet, specifically the Mattermost online community at https://community.mattermost.com. Headquarters is where Mattermost staff work with our communities of colleagues, partners, customers and contributors, to envision, develop and refine new open source technologies to make the world safer and more productive. Staff at headquarters, working in an open source, remote-first company are "Mattermosters". Some staff, for business or stylistic reasons, may work out of an office space, and we call the subset of these Mattermosters "Commuters". We have office space for commuters in San Francisco, California.
