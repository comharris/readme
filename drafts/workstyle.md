# WIP - Mattermost Workstyle 

Mattermost is an open source, remote-first company.

Open source means by default we make our technology, business process and source code available to the public, while maintaining a minority portion as propreitary technology, built on our open source work, to license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source work to be produced. We believe technology for good is technology for all and the intention of our model is to accelerate the development of quality of security-conscious, open source solutions in the world. 

Remote-first means by default we enable our staff to work anywhere in the world that supports quality video conferencing where we're legally allowed. Mattermost was born in an extraordinary age where organizations can attract, hire and enable remote teams--working out of homes coffee shops and co-working spaces across timezones--to produce faster, better technology and business results than purely office-based teams. By default, we hire anywhere. For a minority of roles, we may prioritize or constrain geographies due to business needs.
