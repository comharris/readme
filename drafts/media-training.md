# WIP: Media Training 

Notes on talking to press and media.

Pre-work
- Write down 5 key messages with talking points that you want to convey. During the interview, cross off the list as you communicate each 
- Make sure you're taking the interview in a quiet environment with solid phone and internet connection 

During the interview 

- Start by asking a few questions to understand how to the most helpful to the reporter:  
  - Start by confirming how much time the reporter has to talk.
    - Ask if there's anything else to cover so there's enough time for everything 
  - Ask the reporter the story focus, how you can help, what he/she wants from the interview
  	- If it’s the first interview with the reporter, or it has been more than 6 months, ask if before the interview starts whether you can give them a 30,000-foot level overview about the company and why their readers would be interested. 
    - Make this elevator pitch super interesting, not salesy  
    - Get across best points about company. Press will pull from press release/blog or website, could end up on old page or old press, what you want is the shortest, freshest most compelling summary at the top of the reporter's notes.
      - Example: We discovered a massive gap in the collaboration market while running a video game company. It turns out a lot of companies need secure communication solutions they fully control. It's now proven by so many customers (names, names, names).  
	
- Be engaging and friendly
- Bridge questions to your key messages 
- Short answers are best
- Support key points you make with customer examples
- Flag key points you make in your answers
- Never repeat a reporter’s negative question; always be positive
- Never mention another media outlet
- If you don’t know the answer, say you’ll get back with the information
- It’s never off the record
- Summarize your key message at the end of every interview after the reporter asks if they covered everything or missed anything

After the interview 

- Follow-up quickly with any information the reporter needs
